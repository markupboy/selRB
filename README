Launching the Selenium Server:
- from a command line, navigate to the "server" directory ("../server" from here)
- run the command "java -jar selenium-server.jar"

Configuring a Custom Firefox Template:
Note: this is necessary to avoid running in to self-signed certificate security errors
- On the Mac platform
	- from a command line, run the command "/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -P"
	- you've just launched Firefox with the profile manager active
	- click "create new profile"
	- follow the steps presented to create the new profile
	- name the profile "selenium" or something easily recognizable
	- beneath the name input, you'll notice a path to the profile directory, note this directory as we'll need it in a later step (for instance, it defaults to /Users/CURRENTUSERNAME/Library/Application Supprt/Firefox/Profile/SOMEKEY.FirefoxUserName)
	- once the profile is created, highlight the new profile in the list and click "start firefox"
	- once firefox is launched, navigate to all pages where self-signed certificate errors present
	- permanently add exceptions to all errors caused by the site being tested
	- close and quit firefox
	
Launching the Selenium Server with a Custom Firefox Profile:
- from a command line, navigate to the "server" directory ("../server" from here)
- run the command "java -jar selenium-server.jar -firefoxProfileTemplate PROFILEDIRECTORY" where PROFILEDIRECTORY is the directory noted previously when creating the firefox profile
